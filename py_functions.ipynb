        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.**What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  A function is an independent block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def-keyword and can be called anywhere in the program. But a method is a function that is associated with an object. It is defined inside a class and operates on instance attributes. Methods have self as the first parameter to access instance-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Function Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "                   def greet(name):\n",
        "                   return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "                   print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "           class Person:\n",
        "           def _init_(self, name):\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "          def greet(self):\n",
        "          return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
        "                 person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "                  print(person.greet())\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Parameters are placeholder defined in a function’s definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it’s called .\n",
        "\n",
        "**parameters example:** def greet(name, greeting): name and greeting are parameters. Arguments example: greet (“Akash”, “Hello”), “Akash” and “Hello” are arguments .\n",
        "\n",
        "3.**What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, you define functions using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for potential arguments, and a colon, then indent the function body. To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses, optionally with arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Define function Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "                  def greet(name):\n",
        "                  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\t\t\t            Print (greet(akash))\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calling function Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "                        greet(\"Alice\")  # Call the 'greet' function,\n",
        "                        passing \"Alice\" as the argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.**What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The return statement in a Python function terminates its execution and sends a value back to the caller, allowing the function's output to be used elsewhere in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "                  def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "                  result = a + b\n",
        "                  return result  \n",
        "                  sum_value = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
        "                  print(sum_value)\n",
        "\n",
        "5.**What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: An Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over. An Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object. We can generate an iterator when we pass the   object to the iter() method. We use the __next__() method for iterating.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.**Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, a generator is a function that yields a sequence of values on demand, rather than storing them all in memory at once, using the yield keyword. This is done by defining a function with yield statements, which pauses execution and returns a value, resuming from where it left off when called again.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of generators:**\n",
        "\n",
        "                          def simple_generator():\n",
        "                          yield 1\n",
        "                          yield 2\n",
        "                          yield 3\n",
        "                          for value in simple_generator():\n",
        "                          print(value)\n",
        "\n",
        "7.**What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Generators offer advantages over regular functions, particularly when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, due to their memory efficiency and ability to yield values one at a time, enabling lazy evaluation and streamlined data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "           def generate_squares_regular(n):\n",
        "           squares = []\n",
        "           for i in range(n):\n",
        "           squares.append(i**2)\n",
        "           return squares\n",
        "           def generate_squares_generator(n):\n",
        "           for i in range(n):\n",
        "           yield i**2\n",
        "           for square in generate_squares_generator(10):\n",
        "           print(square)\n",
        "\n",
        "8.**What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword, typically used for short, simple operations or when a function is needed only once, often as an argument to other functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "          square = x:x*x\n",
        "          Print(square(5)) # output : 25\n",
        "\n",
        "9.**Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator that yields the transformed results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    squares = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
        "    print(list(squares)) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "\n",
        "10.**What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, map() applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results, while filter() applies a function to each item and returns a new iterable containing only the items where the function returns True, and reduce() (from functools) applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**  \n",
        "         \n",
        "         numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "         # map\n",
        "         doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))\n",
        "         print(f\"Doubled numbers: {doubled_numbers}\")  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
        "         # filter\n",
        "         even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
        "         print(f\"Even numbers: {even_numbers}\")  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
        "         # reduce\n",
        "         sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
        "         print(f\"Sum of numbers: {sum_of_numbers}\")  # Output: 15\n",
